        <p>
          I am a 2022 graduate with 2.5 years of hands-on experience as a MEAN stack developer. During my time at Infosys, I completed an e-commerce website project and later upskilled by diving into React.js. My recent projects include a React social media application and a personal portfolio website. I have strong programming skills in C++, Python, and Java, and I am eager to contribute to innovative projects and grow as a full-stack developer.
